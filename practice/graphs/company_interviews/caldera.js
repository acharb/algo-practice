// You are given an NxM chessboard where every cell has a non-negative integer value written on it.
// Place a bishop on the board such that the sum of all cells attacked by the bishop is maximal.
// Return the maximal value.

// The bishop attacks in all directions diagonally, and there is no limit to the distance
// which the bishop can attack. Note that the cell on which the bishop is placed is also
// considered attacked.
